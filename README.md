<b></b> (DON' t use hold over from when HTML did not use CSS)

The <b> tag specifies bold text. According to the HTML 5 specification, the <b> tag should be used as a LAST resort when no other tag is more appropriate. The HTML 5 specification states that headings should be denoted with the <h1> to <h6> (Links to an external site.) tags, emphasized text should be denoted with the <em> (Links to an external site.) tag, important text should be denoted with the <strong> (Links to an external site.) tag, and marked/highlighted text should use the <mark> (Links to an external site.) tag. You can also use the CSS "font-weight" property to set bold text. 

<i></i> 

The <i> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content of the <i> tag is usually displayed in italic.

The <i> tag can be used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from another language, a thought, or a ship name, etc.

Use the <i> element only when there is not a more appropriate semantic element, such as:

<em> (Links to an external site.) (emphasized text)
<strong> (Links to an external site.) (important text)
<mark> (Links to an external site.) (marked/highlighted text)
<cite> (Links to an external site.) (the title of a work)
<dfn> (Links to an external site.) (a definition term)
